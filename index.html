                    <p>Considered the largest painting in the Philippines, 
“Spoliarium” is among the notable art pieces of Filipino painter Juan Luna. 
It features the bloody gladiator matches of Romans but is also an allegory to the despair and abuses 
Filipinos suffered from during the Spanish reign in the country.</p>

                    <p>This painting depicts the first mass celebrated in Limasawa Island 
in present day-Southern Leyte, officiated by Fr. Pedro Valderrama, the official chaplain of the 
Magellan expedition. The national government commissioned Francisco to create the artwork for the 
commemoration  of 400 years of Philippine Christianization. He led the first mass as requested by 
Ferdinand Magellan in an improvised altar and a platform made of bamboo.</p>

                    <h2>by: Fernando Amorsolo</h2>
                    <p>The entrance of American colonists sparked a fresh wave of nationalism in Philippine society, 
which may be seen most clearly in the work of Fernando Amorsolo.  The periods artwork centred on depictions of 
traditional folk settings as a vehicle for expressing an idealised feeling of nationhood.
<br>
Amorsolo presented motifs which portrayed sights common to the Philippines. This included depictions of Filipinos 
taking part in common hobbies and customs, as well as partaking in work such as farming activities.
<br>
In hindsight, some historians have concluded that Amorsolo’s paintings mirrored the people’s yearning 
to escape from a complicated reality into simplicity. In contrast, others have claimed that his 
paintings depicted an idealised picture of life during those times.</p>

                    <h1>Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho </h1>
                    <h2>by: Felix Resurrecion Hidalgo</h2>
                    <p>This painting was a silver medalist during the 1884 Exposicion General 
de Bellas Artes in Madrid, Spain, also known as the Madrid Exposition. Hidalgo’s winning 
the silver medal for the painting was a landmark achievement that proved the ability of 
Filipinos to match the work of Spaniards and laid claim to Filipino participation in European culture.
<br>An oil on canvas painting measuring 1.15 m × 1.57 m (45 in × 62 in), Las Virgenes Cristianas 
Expuestas al Populacho is a "landmark painting" depicting the persecution of Christians in Ancient Rome.
Described as a masterpiece remarkable in the aspects of quality, composition, and historical context,
it portrays two scantily clothed Christian female slaves being mocked by a group of boorish Roman male onlookers.
One of the women is posed seated naked at the foreground of the painting with her "head bowed in misery".
The semi-nude women have been stripped not only of their garments but also of their dignity. Created in the academic style of Europe, 
the unfortunate women in the artwork are considered by some indigenous Filipinos as virgins "being led out, stolen from, and ridiculed". 
The women are young virgins cornered by a mob of "sexually hungry" Roman men. One of the men has his hand over one semi-naked 
female whose eyes are "looking up to heaven" asking and begging for "help that never comes"</p>

                    <h1>Inabel and Binakol Weaving</h1>
                    <h2>by: Nelia Ardaniel</h2>
                    <p>Nelia Ardaniel is an Inabel weaver from Abra, 
a region that is also well-known for Cordillera weaving.
<br>Coming from the Ilocano word abel (weave), “inabel” can be interpreted to 
mean a kind of sturdy but wearable textile found in the Ilocano provinces of 
the Philippines.
<br>A popular variation of the abel weave is the binakol (also known as binakel, 
binakael, or binakul), which features geometric patterns similar to those of optical illusions. 
This psychedelic design is meant to represent waves, and its confusing pattern is believed to 
protect the wearer from malicious spirits.</p>

                    <p>In 1990, Go was recognized by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts 
as a National Folk Artist, for his exceptional skill and work in the burnayan.
<br>Vigan City is widely known across the country for its incredible handmade pottery,
which delights local and international tourists alike. Burnay (jar) production was originally introduced 
by Chinese migrants in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur from the 18th to 19th century. The Bantug clay used 
to make the jars is formed with the artisan’s hands while a potter’s wheel is operated by foot. Afterwards, 
the jars are air-dried, and then finally cooked in a kiln.</p>

                    <h1>Pina Cloth Weaving </h1>
                    <h2>by: Raquel Eliserio</h2>
                    <p>Multi-awarded Raquel Eliserio comes from a family of piña weavers based in Balete, 
Aklan.
<br>The leaves of the Red Spanish pineapple are scraped by hand with shards of 
porcelain and sharpened coconut shell to produce the finest filaments of piña fiber. The old tradition 
of suksuk or creating an inlay pattern is a technique where “the warp is 
counted according to desired pattern and pulled up using cotton threads and numbered fern sticks.” 
More piña fibers are inserted through the warp and weft to create designs embedded in the 
fabric — this is used in lieu of embroidering the fabric. This process created the ecru tissue look of Ms. Eliserio’s winning design.</p>

                    <h2>by: Haja Amina Appi</h2>
                    <p>Haja Amina Appi (d. 2013) was bestowed with the GAMABA in 2004, 
further acknowledging the talents of mat artisans in Mindanao. As the master mat weaver 
of Tandubas, Tawi-Tawi, her colorful mats are known to exhibit her eye for design and symmetry.
<br>The process, which is exclusively carried out by women, begins with harvesting thorny pandan leaves. 
The thorns are first removed with a knife, and then the leaves are ripped into long strips. 
After the strips are sun-dried and pressed, they are dyed in boiling water. 
Artisans can only begin the actual weaving process once these strips have been sun-dried again.</p>

        <h2>Arts&Crafts in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>These are just a few examples of the many talented artisans in the Philippines. 
Their work represents the rich cultural heritage of Filipinos, and up to this day, continues 
to inspire and captivate people across the country and around the world.
<br>The Philippines is a country that is rich in culture and arts. 
From the colorful festivals, intricate weavings, and visual arts, the country boasts 
of remarkable cultural treasures that showcase the creativity, talent, and passion 
of its people. 
<br>Art and artists in the Philippines don’t get enough recognition and support. 
People who pursue artistic careers, are often not taken seriously, or they’re even 
looked down on, as it is believed that it’s a career that won’t “feed you“, or 
“provide you a roof over your head“, neglecting the importance art has in our lives 
and crashing many people’s dreams and passions. Support Filipino art because it deserves 
to be recognized more. Art can be a powerful tool to express yourself, when your voice cannot be heard.</p>
